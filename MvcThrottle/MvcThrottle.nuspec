    <title>ASP.NET MVC Rate Limit Improved</title>
    <requireLicenseAcceptance>false</requireLicenseAcceptance>
    <description>MvcThrottleImproved is a enhanced version of the old MvcThrottle with some new features. It's designed for controlling the rate of requests that clients can make to a website based on IP address, request route, user-agent and client identity. You can set multiple limits for different scenarios like allowing an IP to make a maximum number of calls per second, per minute, per hour or per day. You can define these limits to address all requests made to your website or you can scope the limits to each Controller, Action or URL, with or without query string params.</description>
